Object Oriented programming was developed to handle rapidly increasing size and complexity of software systems and to make it easier to modify these large and complex systems over time. In Object Oriented Programming, the focus is on creation of objects containing both data and functionality together. Generally, each object definition corresponds to some object or concept in real world and the functions that operate on the object correspond to the ways real-world objects interact.


* Class Inheritance allows to reuse code making it a lot more concise and easier to read
* Test cases specify what a function or a class should do within a code
