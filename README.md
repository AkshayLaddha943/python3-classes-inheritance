# python3-class-inheritance

Object Oriented programming was developed to handle rapidly increasing size and complexity of software systems and to make it easier to modify these large and complex systems over time. In Object Oriented Programming, the focus is on creation of objects containing both data and functionality together. Generally, each object definition corresponds to some object or concept in real world and the functions that operate on the object correspond to the ways real-world objects interact.


* Class Inheritance allows to reuse code making it a lot more concise and easier to read
* Test cases specify what a function or a class should do within a code
* In Python, every value is actually an object. Whether it be a dictionary, a list, or even an integer, they are all objects
* JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. JSON-formatted string in Python are generally converted into a python object, a list or a dictionary.


An object has a state and a collection of methods that it can perform. The state of an object represents those things that the object knows about itself. The state is stored in instance variables

Classes are generally defined by the user or Python language. classes like str, int, float and list are all defined by Python and are available to use.





# python3-pointers

Every variable has a corresponding memory location and every memory location has a corresponding address defined for it. Pointers store the address of other variables

A Python object comprises of three parts:

* Reference count: number of variables that refer to a particular memory location
* Type: refers to the object type. Examples of Python types include int, float, string, and boolean
* Value: is the actual value of the object that is stored in the memory
